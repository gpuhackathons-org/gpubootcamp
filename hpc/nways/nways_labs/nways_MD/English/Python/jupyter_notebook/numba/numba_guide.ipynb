    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "- **The goal of this lab is to:**\n",
    "    -   quickly get you started with Numba from beginner to advanced level\n",
    "    -   teach you application of CUDA GPU programming concept in HPC field(s)\n",
    "    -   show you how to maximize the throughput of your HPC implementation through computational speedup on the GPU.  \n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Introduction\n",
    "- Numba is a just-in-time (jit) compiler for Python that works best on code that uses NumPy arrays, functions, and loops. Numba has set of decorators that can be specified before user-defined functions to determine how they are compiled.  \n",
    "- A decorated function written in python is compiled into CUDA kernel to speed up execution rate, thus, Numba supports CUDA GPU programming model. \n",
    "- A kernel is written in Numba automatically have direct access to NumPy arrays. This implies a great support for data visiblilty between the host (CPU) and the device (GPU). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Definition of Terms\n",
    "- The CPU is called a **Host**.  \n",
    "- The GPU is called a **Device**.\n",
    "- A GPU function launched by the host and executed on the device is called a **Kernels**.\n",
    "- A GPU function executed on the device which can only be called from the device is called a **Device function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note\n",
    "- It is recommended to visit the NVIDIA official documentary web page and read through [CUDA C programming guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide), because most CUDA programming features exposed by Numba map directly to the CUDA C language offered by NVidia. \n",
    "- Numba does not implement of these CUDA features of CUDA:\n",
    "     - dynamic parallelism\n",
    "     - texture memory\n",
    "\n",
    "## CUDA Kernel\n",
    "- In CUDA, written code can be executed by hundreds or thousands of threads at a single run, hence, a solution is modeled after the following thread hierarchy: \n",
    "    - **Grid**: A kernel executed as a collection of blocks \n",
    "    - **Thread Block**: Collection of threads that can communicate via a shared memory. Each thread is executed by a core.\n",
    "    - **Thread**: Single execution units that run kernels on GPU.\n",
    "- Numba exposes three kinds of GPU memory: \n",
    "    - global device memory  \n",
    "    - shared memory \n",
    "    - local memory. \n",
    "- Memory access should be carefully considered in order to keep bandwidth contention at minimal.\n",
    "\n",
    " <img src=\"../images/thread_blocks.JPG\"/> <img src=\"../images/memory_architecture.png\"/> \n",
    "\n",
    "### Kernel Declaration\n",
    "- A kernel function is a GPU function that is called from a CPU code by specifying the number of block threads and threads per block, and can not explicitly return a value except through a passed array. \n",
    "- A kernel can be called multiple times with varying number of blocks per grid and threads per block after its has been compiled once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@cuda.jit\n",
    "def arrayAdd(array_A, array_B, array_out):\n",
    "    #...code body ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "###### Kernel Invocation\n",
    "- A kernel is typically launched in the following way:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "threadsperblock = 128\n",
    "N = array_out.size\n",
    "blockspergrid = ( N + (threadsperblock - 1))// threadsperblock\n",
    "arrayAdd[blockspergrid, threadsperblock](array_A, array_B, array_out)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Choosing Block Size\n",
    "- The block size determines how many threads share a given area of shared memory.\n",
    "- The block size must be large enough to accommodate all computation units. See more details [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thread Positioning \n",
    "- When running a kernel, the kernel function’s code is executed by every thread once. Hence is it important to uniquely identify distinct threads.\n",
    "- The default way to determine a thread position in a grid and block is to manually compute the corresponding array position:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/thread_position.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "threadsperblock = 128\n",
    "N = array_out.size\n",
    "\n",
    "@cuda.jit\n",
    "def arrayAdd(array_A, array_B, array_out):\n",
    "    tid = cuda.threadIdx.x + cuda.blockIdx.x * cuda.blockDim.x\n",
    "    if tid < N: #Check array boundaries\n",
    "        array_out[tid] =  array_A[tid] + array_B[tid]\n",
    "\n",
    "#Unless you are sure the block size and grid size are a divisor of your array size, you must check boundaries as shown in the code block above. \n",
